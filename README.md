# Arena navigation — Roomba-style collecting & disposing car

A Raspberry Pi car that sweeps a closed, known-size **rectangular** arena in a
serpentine ("boustrophedon") pattern, collecting blocks in a front bucket
("багер") and dumping them out the **back** (waste-truck style) at a fixed
disposal **pit**. It holds a straight heading with a **BNO086 IMU** and measures
its position against the **known walls** using **3 front ultrasonic sensors**
(distance to the end wall = how far down the lane it is), so localization survives
a bumpy floor. Wheel-time odometry is only a short bridge when a wall isn't seen.

The car runs a small state machine — **DRIVING → TURNING → DISPOSING → … → DONE** —
in one continuous flow: it sweeps and collects, and whenever its estimated position
reaches the pit it stops, backs its rear over the pit, dumps, and resumes; once all
lanes are swept it stops for good.

**Localization is wall-referenced, not time-based.** Because the arena has bumps
(wheels slip, so "distance = speed × time" drifts), position is measured against
the known walls instead: the front sensors' distance to the end wall _is_ how far
down the lane the car is, and lane-counting gives which lane it's on. Wheel-time
odometry is only a short-gap **bridge** when a wall momentarily isn't seen. See §1.

**Everything you tune lives in [`config.py`](config.py).** You should never have
to edit the logic files to change behaviour — read this doc, open `config.py`,
change numbers. The rest of this README explains what each number does.

> **Servos are not wired yet.** Block counting (collection servo) and the actual
> tip mechanism (disposal servo) are **placeholders** in [`actuators.py`](actuators.py)
> that only log — the whole state machine runs and is testable without them. See
> §7 for where they plug in.

## 1. The big picture: how the car drives

The car runs one loop (`main.py`): **read IMU + sensors → decide → drive**,
~20×/sec. Every tick it updates its estimated **pose** (x, y, heading) and prints
a full status line (see §6).

```
        ┌─ at the pit? (wall-referenced position) ─ yes ─► DISPOSE
        │                                                  (face back at pit, dump)
read ──►│─ end of lane? (believed wall within standoff, ─ yes ─► U-TURN into next lane
        │   ≥2/3 agree, held a few ticks)                       (spin 90°, shift, spin 90°)
        │
        └─ else ─► CRUISE forward, holding the lane heading with the IMU
```

### Where "position" comes from

The car starts in the **bottom-left corner** at `(START_X_CM, START_Y_CM)` = `(0, 0)`,
**facing straight along the arena length**. That facing becomes **heading 0**.

- **+y** = straight ahead, up a lane (along `ARENA_LENGTH_CM`).
- **+x** = to the car's right, across the arena (along `ARENA_WIDTH_CM`).

Each coordinate has a **slip-immune** source:

| Quantity           | Source                                                                                                                                   | Bumps affect it?     |
| ------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------- |
| **heading**        | IMU yaw                                                                                                                                  | no                   |
| **cross-lane `x`** | lane counting (`x += sweep × LANE_WIDTH` per U-turn); the IMU heading-hold keeps the car square so it stays centred in the lane | no                   |
| **along-lane `y`** | **front wall**: `y` derived from the measured gap to the end wall                                                                        | no                   |
| _(fallback)_       | wheel-time odometry `DRIVE_CM_PER_S × time` — only bridges brief gaps                                                                    | yes, but rarely used |

So `DRIVE_CM_PER_S` is **not** the primary position source anymore — it only bridges
the odd tick a wall isn't seen, provides a rough "where should the wall be" prior,
and times the sideways lane-shift. It can no longer drift you into the wrong place.

### Cruising — DRIVING (the normal state)

The car drives forward at `DRIVE_SPEED`, **holding the lane's target heading with
the IMU** (steering trim ∝ heading error, `HEADING_HOLD_GAIN` clamped to
`MAX_HEADING_TRIM`) — this keeps it square to the wall, which is what makes the
wall distance read cleanly. If a wall is within `FRONT_SLOW_DISTANCE_CM` it slows to
`SLOW_SPEED`. Every tick it derives `y` from the front wall (when seen) or bridges
on odometry, and logs which (`y_src=WALL` / `y_src=BRIDGE`).

> No IMU? Cruising falls back to **open-loop straight** (no steering trim).

### Trusting the wall — rejecting bumps, blocks, and misses

A close front reading is only believed to be the **end wall** when all three hold:

1. **≥`FRONT_AGREE_MIN_COUNT` of 3 front sensors agree** within `FRONT_AGREE_TOL_CM`.
   A real wall spans the whole (edge-to-edge) front; a narrow block/bump shows up on
   one sensor and is outvoted.
2. **It's near where a wall is expected** (odometry prior, within `WALL_EXPECT_TOL_CM`).
   A wide object mid-lane can't be the end wall, so it's treated as a block to
   collect (slow, drive on), not the lane end.
3. **It persists `WALL_PERSIST_TICKS` ticks.** Kills single-frame glitches.

If the wall momentarily **drops out** (angled/specular miss), `y` coasts on odometry
while the IMU keeps the car square so the wall re-appears (and the odometry backstop
still ends the lane if it never does).

### End of a lane — TURNING (the U-turn)

The lane is "over" when a **believed wall** (all three rules above) is within
`FRONT_STOP_DISTANCE_CM` — a fixed, measured standoff that stays consistent across
bumps. If the front sensors give **no** agreed wall for the whole lane, an odometry
**backstop** (`ARENA_LENGTH_CM − LANE_END_MARGIN_CM`) turns anyway so it can't drive
blind forever. Either way it does a **U-turn into the next lane** as one atomic
maneuver:

1. **Spin 90°** in place.
2. **Drive forward `LANE_WIDTH_CM`** — the sideways shift into the next lane.
3. **Spin 90° the same direction** — now facing back down the new lane.

Turn direction **alternates every U-turn**, starting with `SERPENTINE_FIRST_TURN`
(**right** from a bottom-left start), so the car steps `+x` across the arena and
snakes back and forth. After the maneuver the code reverses the target heading and
**increments the lane index** (which is what sets the new cross-lane `x` — exactly,
no dependence on how far the physical shift actually went).

### Reaching the pit — DISPOSING

The pit sits in the **middle of the start wall** (`PIT_X_CM ≈ WIDTH/2, PIT_Y_CM ≈ 0`)
and is **small — about the size of the car — so the rear is placed directly over
it**, not just aimed at it. Because it's on the start wall and each lane touches
that wall at its own `x`, the sweep **passes the pit exactly once** — on the one
lane whose `x` matches the pit. When the pose comes within `PIT_ARRIVAL_RADIUS_CM`
of the pit, the car enters **DISPOSING** and runs a 5-step maneuver:

1. Turn so its **back** faces the pit (`DISPOSE_BACK_INTO_PIT`).
2. **Reverse `DISPOSE_REVERSE_CM`** (slowly, `DISPOSE_REVERSE_SPEED`) to seat the
   rear over the pit — tune so the rear overhangs but the drive wheels stay on the
   edge.
3. Hold `DISPOSE_HOLD_S` and **dump** (placeholder until the servo lands).
4. **Pull `DISPOSE_REVERSE_CM` forward** to get clear of the pit.
5. Re-orient to the lane heading and return to DRIVING.

It won't re-trigger until it leaves and re-enters the pit zone.

### Finishing up — DONE + a final dump

The arena is `NUM_LANES` lanes wide (config, by default `ceil(ARENA_WIDTH_CM /
LANE_WIDTH_CM)`). The car counts lanes as it sweeps; when it finishes the last one
(`lane_index` reaches `NUM_LANES − 1`) it enters **DONE**. Because the sweep passed
the pit only once (mid-way), blocks collected afterwards are still aboard, so DONE
triggers **one final trip back to the pit**:

1. Drive to the **start wall** (the pit's side), wherever the sweep ended.
2. Drive to the **left wall**, then turn to face across and drive until the **far
   (right) wall** is `WIDTH − PIT_X` away — which puts the car at the pit's middle.
   Both legs stop on a _front-wall_ distance, so the whole return is wall-referenced
   (no odometry), and the car-sized pit + reverse gives the tolerance.
3. Face the start wall so the back points at the pit, **reverse in and dump**, then
   stop for good.

Override `NUM_LANES` in config to sweep fewer/more lanes than the plain division gives.

> **Full-bucket gate (future):** today disposal triggers purely on **arriving** at
> the pit. Once the collection servo reports a real block count, flip
> `_should_dispose()` in `navigation.py` to gate on `collector.is_full()` — a
> one-line change, already marked with a TODO.

### Skid steer (how it physically moves)

It's a **tank / skid-steer** car: two sides (left, right), each with a direction
pin and a PWM speed pin. Forward = both sides forward. Turn in place = one side
forward, the other reverse. No steering servo. See `motors.py`.

---

## 2. How turning works (read this before tuning turns)

The 90° spins are the same closed-loop IMU turns as before, chosen by
`USE_IMU_TURN`:

### A) IMU closed-loop turns (`USE_IMU_TURN = True`, recommended)

The car spins and **watches its real heading**, stopping once it has actually
rotated `TURN_ANGLE_DEG` (minus `IMU_TURN_TOLERANCE_DEG` for coast). Accurate as
the battery drains or friction changes — no hand-tuned timing. It accumulates the
heading change sample-by-sample (wrap-safe around ±180°), ignores corrupted I2C
spikes (`IMU_GLITCH_MAX_STEP_DEG`), and has a hard timeout (`IMU_TURN_TIMEOUT_S`).

**Stall recovery (tire-tension boost).** Spinning in place scrubs the tires; if
after `IMU_TURN_BOOST_AFTER_S` the IMU shows **less than half** of `TURN_ANGLE_DEG`
turned, the code **bumps the spin speed** (by `IMU_TURN_BOOST_FACTOR`, capped at
1.0) to break through, and holds it. You'll see a `[u-turn] stall: ...` log line.

Disposal's "point the back at the pit" also uses the IMU — it rotates to the
absolute target heading and re-checks each poll, so a small overshoot self-corrects.

### B) Timed open-loop turns (`USE_IMU_TURN = False`, or no IMU)

The car spins at `TURN_SPEED` for `TURN_TIME_S` seconds and hopes that's 90°.
Simple, no IMU, but you must **measure `TURN_TIME_S`** and it drifts with battery.
For early bring-up only.

> The sideways lane shift (step 2 of the U-turn) is open-loop timed as
> `LANE_WIDTH_CM / DRIVE_CM_PER_S` seconds. It needn't be precise — lane counting
> handles *which* lane, and the coverage overlap (`LANE_WIDTH_CM < ROBOT_WIDTH_CM`)
> absorbs a slightly short/long step.

## 3. Two run modes: drive test vs. navigation

`USE_SENSORS` in `config.py` picks what `main.py` does:

- **`USE_SENSORS = False` → open-loop drive test.** Runs the hardcoded
  `DRIVE_TEST_SEQUENCE` and **never reads the ultrasonics**. Use this _first_ to
  confirm motors, H-bridge wiring, and turning. (`left`/`right` steps still use the
  IMU if `USE_IMU_TURN = True`.)
- **`USE_SENSORS = True` → full IMU + odometry navigation with disposal.** The real
  read → decide → drive loop described in §1.

---

## 4. Quickstart for the car

```bash
# 1. Bring-up: check motors + turning, no sensors needed.  (config.py: USE_SENSORS = False)
python3 main.py

# 2. Check the front sensors: on a flat wall all three should read ~the same
#    (they "agree"); wave a small object in front of ONE and confirm the others
#    still see the wall. Position is wall-referenced, so this is what matters most.

# 3. Set DRIVE_CM_PER_S roughly (drive a known time, measure, divide). It's only a
#    fallback/bridge now, so a ballpark value is fine.

# 4. Verify the heading convention on the bench: a "right" turn must step the car
#    toward the arena (+x), not into the start wall. If mirrored, see §8.

# 5. Set the real arena, start pose, and PIT_X_CM / PIT_Y_CM.  Go live: USE_SENSORS = True
python3 main.py
```

Off the car (laptop, no Pi) everything still runs — motors print intent, sensors
read "nothing", the IMU reports unavailable (open-loop straight). Useful checks:

```bash
python3 test_navigation.py     # unit tests for the decision logic
python3 simulate.py            # time-stepped run: wall-referenced cruise -> wall turn -> dispose
python3 sensor_test.py         # read & print all sensors (wiring check, on Pi)
python3 sensor_diagnostics.py  # per-sensor pins + raw samples (debug, on Pi)
python3 imu_turn_test.py       # spin once using the IMU and report the result
```

Stop the car any time with **Ctrl-C** — it stops the motors and cleans up GPIO.

| `ARENA_LENGTH_CM`     | Arena size along each lane (the +y runs). The wall reference measures against this.                                                                                                         | Match your real arena.                                             |

| `LANE_WIDTH_CM`       | Sideways shift per U-turn. **Must be ≤ `ROBOT_WIDTH_CM`** or it leaves gaps; a little less overlaps.                                                                                        | Tune coverage vs. speed.                                           |
| `NUM_LANES`           | How many lanes = a full sweep; the car STOPS (DONE) after finishing the last one. Default `ceil(ARENA_WIDTH_CM / LANE_WIDTH_CM)`.                                                           | Override to sweep fewer/more lanes.                                |
| `FULL_SPEED_CM_PER_S` | The **one** speed calibration: cm/s at full duty. `DRIVE_CM_PER_S` derives from it (`× DRIVE_SPEED`), so the distance estimate tracks `DRIVE_SPEED` automatically — no separate re-measure. | Measure once (drive at `DRIVE_SPEED`, cm/s ÷ `DRIVE_SPEED`).       |
| `DRIVE_CM_PER_S`      | **Derived** (`FULL_SPEED_CM_PER_S × DRIVE_SPEED`), not hardcoded. Fallback/bridge only — sensor-dropout bridge, the "expected wall" prior, and lane-shift timing.                           | Don't set directly; change `DRIVE_SPEED` or `FULL_SPEED_CM_PER_S`. |
| `LANE_END_MARGIN_CM`  | Odometry **backstop**: turn this far before the far wall _only if a wall is never seen_ the whole lane.                                                                                     | Tune.                                                              |

| --------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `START_X_CM` / `START_Y_CM` | Where the car begins, in the (x, y) frame. Default `(0, 0)` = bottom-left corner. **Place the car to match.**                            |
| `SERPENTINE_FIRST_TURN`     | Which way the first U-turn curls: `"right"` from a bottom-left start (steps +x), `"left"` from a bottom-right start. Then it alternates. |

### 5.3 Disposal pit

| ----------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `PIT_X_CM` / `PIT_Y_CM` | Fixed pit centre in the (x, y) frame. **Set to the real pit location.**                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| `PIT_ARRIVAL_RADIUS_CM` | How close the pose must get to count as "at the pit". **Must be ≥ `FRONT_STOP_DISTANCE_CM`** (the car can't reach a wall pit closer than the turn standoff, so a smaller value means it never disposes). Disposal is lane-gated, so a generous radius is safe. |
| `DISPOSE_BACK_INTO_PIT` | `True` = rotate so the back faces the pit before reversing (needs the IMU).                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| `DISPOSE_REVERSE_CM`    | How far to reverse (after orienting) to seat the rear over the small, car-sized pit. **Tune** so the rear overhangs but the drive wheels stay on the edge. Pulled forward again after dumping.                                                                 |
| `DISPOSE_REVERSE_SPEED` | Speed (0..1) for that reverse/pull — slow, for precise placement.                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| `DISPOSE_HOLD_S`        | Placeholder dwell while "dumping" (until the disposal servo lands).                                                                                                                                                                                            |

### 5.4 Collection (future servo)

| Setting                      | What it does                                                                                                                                  |
| ---------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `COLLECTION_CAPACITY_BLOCKS` | The "bucket full" count. Wired to the collection servo later; today the count is a stub (always 0) so disposal triggers on pit arrival alone. |

### 5.5 Sensors (`SENSORS` dict + groupings)

Each sensor is `name: {"trig": <pin>, "echo": <pin>, "enabled": <bool>}` in **BCM**.
The array has **5 positions — 3 front, 2 back**. There are **no side sensors**:
localisation uses the front wall for position and the IMU for heading, so there is
no side-wall logic. Only the front sensors are read by the nav today; the back pair
is earmarked for future reverse/disposal assistance.

- **`trig` / `echo`** — match your wiring; keep clear of the motor pins (`12, 13, 16,
20`) and the IMU I2C pins (`2, 3`). Every **enabled** sensor needs unique pins.
- **`enabled`** — `False` leaves that sensor's pins untouched and it always reports
  "no echo". Flip to `True` as you bring each up.
- **Groupings** — **`FRONT_SENSORS`** (the primary position reference; mount spread
  edge-to-edge, outboard of the bucket, level, above block height — see `config.py`)
  and **`BACK_SENSORS`** (reserved; earmarked for reverse/disposal assistance).

| ------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `FRONT_STOP_DISTANCE_CM` | **PRIMARY:** turn when the believed end wall is this close — a fixed, measured standoff.       |
| `FRONT_SLOW_DISTANCE_CM` | Slow to `SLOW_SPEED` when a wall/object is this close. **Must be > `FRONT_STOP_DISTANCE_CM`.** |

### 5.7 Wall-detection fusion (reject blocks/bumps and misses)

These gate when a close front reading is believed to be the **end wall** (see §1
"Trusting the wall"):

| Setting                 | What it does                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| ----------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `FRONT_AGREE_TOL_CM`    | Front readings within this of each other count as "agreeing".                                                                                                                                                                |
| `FRONT_AGREE_MIN_COUNT` | How many must agree (K). With 3 sensors, `2` = "the median is a real wall, not one stray sensor".                                                                                                                            |
| `WALL_EXPECT_TOL_CM`    | How far the odometry prior may disagree with the measured wall and still trust it. **Generous** (odometry is rough); too tight rejects real walls after drift, too loose lets a wide mid-lane object be called the lane end. |
| `WALL_PERSIST_TICKS`    | Consecutive ticks a close wall must hold before turning (kills single-frame glitches).                                                                                                                                       |

Cross-lane `x` has **no sensor correction** — it comes purely from lane counting,
and the IMU heading-hold keeps the car square so it stays centred in each lane.

| ------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `HEADING_HOLD_GAIN` | Steer trim per degree of heading error. Too high = wobble; too low = slow to straighten. |
| `MAX_HEADING_TRIM`  | Clamp on the heading-hold trim.                                                          |

| `SENSOR_TIMEOUT_S`                            | Give up waiting for an echo after this long.           |
| `SENSOR_SAMPLES`                              | Median-of-N pings per read. Higher = steadier, slower. |
| `SOUND_SPEED_CM_PER_S`                        | Speed of sound for echo→distance. Rarely changed.      |

| `SLOW_SPEED`  | Speed when a wall is getting close.                                          | 0..1    |
| `TURN_SPEED`  | In-place rotation speed (base for IMU and timed spins, and disposal orient). | 0..1    |

| ------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `USE_IMU_TURN`            | **Master switch.** `True` = measured-heading turns (auto-falls back to timed if the IMU is missing). Also gates whether the IMU is opened at all. |
| `TURN_ANGLE_DEG`          | Target rotation for one spin (90°).                                                                                                               |

| `IMU_TURN_TIMEOUT_S`      | Safety cap — a spin never runs longer than this.                                                                                                  |
| `IMU_GLITCH_MAX_STEP_DEG` | Per-sample heading jumps bigger than this are ignored as corrupted reads.                                                                         |

| `IMU_TURN_BOOST_AFTER_S`  | Stall recovery: boost speed if under **half** turned by now. `None` disables.                                                                     |

### 5.12 Motors (`MOTORS` dict)

Each side is `name: {"dir": <pin>, "pwm": <pin>, "invert": <bool>}` in BCM.

- **`dir`** — direction (forward = HIGH). **`pwm`** — speed (0..100% duty).
- **`invert`** — flip if a wheel spins the wrong way (instead of re-wiring).
- `MOTOR_PWM_HZ` — PWM frequency. `MOTOR_DEADZONE` — commands below this = "stop".

### 5.13 Control loop & bring-up

| Setting               | What it does                                                                                           |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `CONTROL_LOOP_HZ`     | How often the car reads + decides (≈20 Hz). Also sets the `dt` used for bridging.                      |
| `USE_SENSORS`         | `False` = drive test, `True` = full navigation.                                                        |
| `DRIVE_TEST_SEQUENCE` | Scripted `(action, seconds)` maneuver for drive-test mode: `"forward"`, `"left"`, `"right"`, `"stop"`. |

## 6. Logging — what the car tells you

At startup, navigation prints a **banner**: arena size, start pose, pit location,
collection capacity, driving mode (IMU heading-hold), turn mode, and
whether real sensor hardware was found.

Then **every control tick** it prints one status line:

```
MODE=DRIVING   | pos=(  35.0, 156.0) hdg=-180.0 tgt=-180.0 lane#1 ld=144.0 y_src=WALL   wall=144.0(x3) | front_left=144.0 ... | yaw= -179.8 | blocks=0/10 | -> FORWARD    (cruising)
```

- **MODE** — DRIVING / TURNING / DISPOSING.
- **pos / hdg / tgt** — estimated position, current & target heading.
- **lane# / ld** — lane index (→ cross-lane `x`, lane-counted) and along-lane distance.
- **y_src** — where along-lane `y` came from: `WALL` (believed wall) or `BRIDGE` (odometry).
- **wall=NN(xK)** — believed wall distance and how many front sensors agreed (`--` = none).
- **sensors** — every raw ultrasonic distance (`--` = no echo / out of range).
- **yaw** — raw IMU heading (`--` if no IMU this tick). **blocks** — collector count / capacity.
- **→ ACTION (reason)** — the decision and why (e.g. `wall 32cm (x3 agree)` vs `odometry backstop (no wall seen)`).

The U-turn and disposal maneuvers add their own `[u-turn] ...`, `[orient] ...`,
`[dispose] ...`, and `[disposer] DUMP ...` lines.

### Where the servos plug in (later)

- **Collection count** — call `Collector.add()` from the collection-servo code and
  read `Collector.is_full()`; then switch `_should_dispose()` in `navigation.py`
  from "arrived at pit" to "arrived **and** full" (TODO marked in the code).
- **Disposal actuation** — drive the tip servo inside `Disposer.dump()`. The
  DISPOSING maneuver (orient back-to-pit, hold, empty) already runs around it.

## 8. Calibration — measure/tune these on the real car

| Setting | How to set it |
|---|---|
| `FULL_SPEED_CM_PER_S` | Drive at `DRIVE_SPEED` for a known time; `cm/s ÷ DRIVE_SPEED`. Err **high** — under-reading can overshoot a lane end with no wall. |
| `DISPOSE_REVERSE_CM` | Tune at the pit so the rear **overhangs but the drive wheels stay on the edge** (no rear sensor — this one can drop a wheel in). |
| `SERPENTINE_FIRST_TURN` | Bench-check a right turn steps the car `+x` (into the arena); flip it if your IMU yaw runs the other way. |
| `PIT_ARRIVAL_RADIUS_CM` | Keep **≥ `FRONT_STOP_DISTANCE_CM`**, or the car never reaches the pit. |
| `FRONT_SERVO_INTERVAL_S` | How often (seconds of driving) the front scoop lifts to `FRONT_SERVO_UP_PULSE_MS`. |

_Front scoop uses calibrated pulse widths (`FRONT_SERVO_DOWN_PULSE_MS` / `FRONT_SERVO_UP_PULSE_MS`). Collection/disposal servos are still placeholders._
